/** Class for translating terms from *one* other solver to *one* new solver
 *  will fail if you try to convert terms from more than one solver
 *  e.g.
 *  SmtSolver s1 = Cvc5SolverFactory::create(false);
 *  SmtSolver s2 = MsatSolverFactory::create(false);
 *  SmtSolver s3 = Cvc5SolverFactory::create(false);
 *
 *  Term x = s1->make_symbol("x", s1->make_sort(INT));
 *  Term y = s2->make_symbol("y", s2->make_sort(INT));
 *
 *  TermTranslator to_s3(s3);
 *  Term x3 = to_s3.transfer_term(x);
 *  // This line would segfault
 *  Term y3 = to_s3.transfer_term(y);
 *  // this is because the cache will already have x, a Term from s1 in it
 *  // and then transferring y from s2 will trigger a comparison between x
 *  // and y. But these are terms from two different solvers and the static
 *  // pointer cast will be an incorrect cast.
 *  // if s2 were also a Cvc5Solver, it depends on how the underlying solver
 *  // handles terms from different instances. In the case of cvc5, it will
 *  // throw an exception
 *
 *  This class has no reference to the other solver because it's not needed
 *  it only needs the solver that's being transferred *to* so that it can
 *  make sorts and terms.
 *  Because symbols can only be declared once, there will be errors
 *  if the symbol is already declared in the new solver. To avoid this
 *  populate the TermTranslator's cache with a mapping from
 *  <other solver's symbol> -> <new solver's symbol>
